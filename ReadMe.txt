1. URL / Source for Dataset:

Mediaeval challende dataset in https://datasets.simula.no/image-sentiment/

2. Requirements : 
	Hardware - A laptop and Internet
   	Software - Google Colab

3. Detailed instructions to execute the source code:

-> First download and upload the dataset in the drive using the dataset link given above.
-> And also upload the csv file.

Task 1 : Single label classification

-> First open the VGG19_task1 file in google colab and connect the file to your drive.
-> Next run the VGG19_task1 and its model will automatically stored in your drive.
-> Make sure you give the drive path correctly in all the places.
-> Next do the same for EfficientNet_task1 and Vision_transformer_task1 file.
-> Now all the models will be saved in drive.
-> Next run the Ensembling_task1 file by providing the correct path to load all the model from the drive.
-> Now the results obtained for the ensembling model can be seen.
-> The ensemble model can be used to classify and show the result for custom images for that in the last second 
section of Ensembling_task1 give the image path in the required array and then run the last two section 
to see the result.

Task 2: Multi label classification

-> First open the VGG19_task2 file in google colab and connect the file to your drive.
-> Next run the VGG19_task1 and its model will automatically stored in your drive.
-> Make sure you give the drive path correctly in all thep places.
-> Next do the same for EfficientNet_task2 and Vision_transformer_task2 file.
-> Now all the models will be saved in drive.
-> Next run the Ensembling_task2 file by providing the correct path to load all the model from the drive.
-> Now the results obtained for the ensembling model can be seen.
-> The ensemble model can be used to classify and show the result for custom images for that in the last second 
section of Ensembling_task2 give the image path in the required array and then run the last two section 
to see the result.
